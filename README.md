The probability of winning a game in Major League Baseball is influenced by several factors, such as the number of rest days a team has and the time of the day that the game occurs. In this paper, I build and discuss a predictive model using these factors for the games played within a season of the MLB. I break down the reasoning for building a predictive model, and the process used to create the model. Historical statistics and pitching data were used in order to create a system of ranking points, defined as Elo, for both the teams involved and the starting five pitchers of the teams. Using the teamâ€™s offensive and defensive Elo points, the pitching strength rating, and other factors such as home-field advantage, Iare able to create a model to predict the outcome of the game. Using historical data, I apply the model on previous seasons to test its accuracy and then apply it to the next MLB season, hoping to see results similar to those from the testing phase of the model. 

This coding was done in to satisfy the requirements of the Dietrich Honors Institute of Thiel College in order for graduation. This project is still a work in progress, and any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. This full project was written in RStudio and was formatted using RMarkdown
